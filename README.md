Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function get_tweet_text() in mycode.php:7 Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in /mycode.php on line 7
Any suggestions on fixing this error?
The code uses the ChatGPT API to post tweets on a given topic to Twitter
Or maybe you can share with me one that work?
